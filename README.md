# Android-Explicit-Intent

Android Explicit intent specifies the component to be invoked from activity. In other words, we can call another activity in android by explicit intent.

We can also pass the information from one activity to another using explicit intent.

In this example,username from first activity is used in second activity and clicking on "GO BACK" button on second activity redirects us to first activity.
